						Hydroelectric power, electricity produced from generators driven by turbines that convert the potential energy of falling or fast-flowing water into mechanical energy. In the early 21st century, hydroelectric power was the most widely utilized form of renewable energy; in 2019 it accounted for more than 18 percent of the world’s total power generation capacity.

                        hydroelectric turbine generators
In the generation of hydroelectric power, water is collected or stored at a higher elevation and led downward through large pipes or tunnels (penstocks) to a lower elevation; the difference in these two elevations is known as the head. At the end of its passage down the pipes, the falling water causes turbines to rotate. The turbines in turn drive generators, which convert the turbines’ mechanical energy into electricity. Transformers are then used to convert the alternating voltage suitable for the generators to a higher voltage suitable for long-distance transmission. The structure that houses the turbines and generators, and into which the pipes or penstocks feed, is called the powerhouse.

					</h2>
					<p class="card-text">
						Hydroelectric power plants are usually located in dams that impound rivers, thereby raising the level of the water behind the dam and creating as high a head as is feasible. The potential power that can be derived from a volume of water is directly proportional to the working head, so that a high-head installation requires a smaller volume of water than a low-head installation to produce an equal amount of power. In some dams, the powerhouse is constructed on one flank of the dam, part of the dam being used as a spillway over which excess water is discharged in times of flood. Where the river flows in a narrow steep gorge, the powerhouse may be located within the dam itself.

In most communities the demand for electric power varies considerably at different times of the day. To even the load on the generators, pumped-storage hydroelectric stations are occasionally built. During off-peak periods, some of the extra power available is supplied to the generator operating as a motor, driving the turbine to pump water into an elevated reservoir. Then, during periods of peak demand, the water is allowed to flow down again through the turbine to generate electrical energy. Pumped-storage systems are efficient and provide an economical way to meet peak loads.

						In certain coastal areas, such as the Rance River estuary in Brittany, France, hydroelectric power plants have been constructed to take advantage of the rise and fall of tides. When the tide comes in, water is impounded in one or more reservoirs. At low tide, the water in these reservoirs is released to drive hydraulic turbines and their coupled electric generators (see tidal power).

Falling water is one of the three principal sources of energy used to generate electric power, the other two being fossil fuels and nuclear fuels. Hydroelectric power has certain advantages over these other sources. It is continually renewable owing to the recurring nature of the hydrologic cycle. It does not produce thermal pollution. (However, some dams can produce methane from the decomposition of vegetation under water.) Hydroelectric power is a preferred energy source in areas with heavy rainfall and with hilly or mountainous regions that are in reasonably close proximity to the main load centers. Some large hydro sites that are remote from load centers may be sufficiently attractive to justify the long high-voltage transmission lines. Small local hydro sites may also be economical, particularly if they combine storage of water during light loads with electricity production during peaks. Many of the negative environmental impacts of hydroelectric power come from the associated dams, which can interrupt the migrations of spawning fish, such as salmon, and permanently submerge or displace ecological and human communities as the reservoirs fill. In addition, hydroelectric dams are vulnerable to water scarcity. In August 2021 Oroville Dam, one of the largest hydroelectric power plants in California, was forced to shut down due to historic drought conditions in the region.

                        A wind farm is a collection of wind turbines that form a type of power plant, producing electricity from wind. There's no official number requirement for an installation to be considered a wind farm, so it could include a few or hundreds of wind turbines working in the same area, whether on land or offshore.

                    <p class="mb-3">
                        Probably the most widely used set of applications of geothermal energy involves the direct use of heated water from the ground without the need for any specialized equipment. All direct-use applications make use of low-temperature geothermal resources, which range between about 50 and 150 °C (122 and 302 °F). Such low-temperature geothermal water and steam have been used to warm single buildings, as well as whole districts where numerous buildings are heated from a central supply source. In addition, many swimming pools, balneological (therapeutic) facilities at spas, greenhouses, and aquaculture ponds around the world have been heated with geothermal resources. <br>
                        Geothermal energy from natural pools and hot springs has long been used for cooking, bathing, and warmth. There is evidence that Native Americans used geothermal energy for cooking as early as 10,000 years ago. In ancient times, baths heated by hot springs were used by the Greeks and Romans. Such uses of geothermal energy were initially limited to sites where hot water and steam were accessible.

Other direct uses of geothermal energy include cooking, industrial applications (such as drying fruit, vegetables, and timber), milk pasteurization, and large-scale snow melting. For many of those activities, hot water is often used directly in the heating system, or it may be used in conjunction with a heat exchanger, which transfers heat when there are problematic minerals and gases such as hydrogen sulfide mixed in with the fluid. Early industrial direct-use applications included the extraction of borate compounds from geothermal fluids at Larderello, Italy, during the early 19th century.

					<h1 class="secondfont mb-3 font-weight-bold">Site Selection</h1>
					<p class="mb-3">
                        The best locations to place a wind turbine are the tops of rounded hills, on open plains (or open water for offshore wind), and mountain passes where wind is naturally funneled through (producing regular high wind speeds). Generally, the higher the elevation the better, since higher elevations usually have more wind.
                        <br>
                        Wind energy forecasting is an important tool for siting a wind turbine. There are a variety of wind speed maps and data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) or the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the U.S. that provide these details.

                        Then, a site-specific survey should be done to assess the local wind conditions and to determine the best direction to place the wind turbines for maximum efficiency. For at least a year, projects on land track wind speed, turbulence, and direction, as well as air temperatures and humidity. Once that information is determined, turbines that will deliver predictable results can be built.
                        <br>
                        It is also possible to break even on your investment in solar panels in about 8 to 10 years, while solar panels begin to noticeably degrade after 25 years. Additionally, grants and subsidies like the ECO4 or Home Upgrade Grant can allow you to receive up to £10,000 in additional funding if you meet the criteria for eligibility, which can further increase your return on investment and further decrease break-even times.  <br>
                        
                        If you’re ready to reap the benefits of solar panels, then you’ll need to find a trusted professional who can provide you with a high-quality installation.

					<p class="mb-3">
                        Challenges to the large-scale implementation of wind energy include siting requirements such as wind availability, aesthetic and environmental concerns, and land availability. Wind farms are most cost-effective in areas with consistent strong winds; however, these areas are not necessarily near large population centers. Thus, power lines and other components of electrical distribution systems must have the capacity to transmit this electricity to consumers. In addition, since wind is an intermittent and inconsistent power source, storing power may be necessary.  <br>

A major concern of wind farms relates to negative environmental impacts associated with noise, visual disturbance, and impacts on wildlife. Two kinds of noise associated with turbines are mechanical noise, which is produced by its equipment such as its gearbox, and aerodynamic noise, which is produced from the movement of air over the blades. Mechanical noise may be dampened by altering mechanical components of turbines. Aerodynamic noise, often described as a “swishing” sound, is a factor of types of blades and speed of rotation. Wind turbine noise in decibels, however, has been found to be no louder than that experienced by traveling in a moving car and is often comparable to nighttime rural background noise. Other concerns involve flicker zones, where light may be reflected off the spinning blades, and pockets of electromagnetic interference that affect television and radio signals within proximity to turbines.

                    <p>Public advocacy groups have raised concerns about the potential disruptions that wind farms may have on wildlife and overall aesthetics. Although wind generators have been blamed for injuring and killing birds, experts have shown that modern turbines have a small effect on bird populations. The National Audubon Society, a large environmental group based in the United States and focused on the conservation of birds and other wildlife, is strongly in favor of wind power, provided that wind farms are appropriately sited to minimize the impacts on migrating bird populations and important wildlife habitat. Notably, a much higher number of bats are reported to have been killed by wind turbines than birds. While the exact cause of those fatalities is unknown, the migration and mating behaviors of migratory tree bats are widely discussed and are currently being researched by biologists.</p>
